JE for Romanum and Bohemia 
1
Something happens 
That results in Boh releasing West Hungary puppet and Romanum releases East Hungary
BOH and ROM have building rights in both Hungaries
When one side has enough influence over BOTH puppets, they merge into HUNGARY and become a puppet of the player with more influence in the Hungarian lands
