all important changes are in files are called "99_player", unless I forgot to name them so. these files should be copy/pasted to a new conversion when needed and other than possibly needing to replace nation tags for custom megacampaign nations with new tags made by a more recent conversion, the files should just work without issue no matter which version the game is.
